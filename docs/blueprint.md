## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Earthy orange (#E07A5F) to evoke warmth and energy in line with sustainability and the earth.
- Background color: Light beige (#F2E8D5), which has a hue slightly to the right of the primary hue in HSL space, for a warm, inviting, and neutral backdrop that evokes concepts of naturalism.
- Accent color: Muted green (#81B29A) for interface accents. The hue is 30 degrees to the left of the primary hue, connoting growth, harmony, and freshness. 
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a modern yet warm sans-serif for a friendly user experience.
- Simple, line-based icons representing food, location, and users to provide clarity and enhance user understanding.
- Use a Bootstrap-like grid system to maintain consistency and responsiveness across different screen sizes.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to enhance user interaction and provide visual feedback on actions (e.g., button hover effects, form input transitions).
